# Unit-4-Game : Crystal Collector :
 
## This is the my submission for the unit 4 homework , View deployed website here : https://archivecoderzero.github.io/unit-4-game/.

## Version 0.1 : 04/16/19
> main iteration of the psuedocode in game.js

## Version 0.4 : 04/19/19
> assets and css completed

> coded random numbers

> coded onclick events

## Version 1.0 : 04/19/19
### this is a working version of Gem Collector , this version has all the functionality described on the homework task . This will be the basis for the remix of this Homework . 
> basic functioning Javascript, Wins / Loss counter , generating a random number and setting that numbers to the respective gems

> basic layout and displaying of the generated numbers into the HTML file . If number specification is required , i can edit it to the homework specific numbers (after i eat :) ) . This is just a proof of concept that my code works as the video explained.

## Version 2.0 : 04/20/19
## This is the final version of this homework, I added the some features on it (see below) , 
> fixed the bug where the win and lose sounds does not proc when conditions are met .

> created a "Your Gem Collection" which appends the chosen gem to the empty div so that you can see which gems you collected. , Hence , the "CRYSTAL COLLECTOR" :) cuz you collect crystals .

> Fixed the range of the "Number to Match" 

> Cosmetic updates , including the position of wins and loss

> plays a unique sound when the a crate is opened for the first time each round .

> added a game mechanic for each gem , the GREEN Gem has low range , and a constant , the RED Gem has a high range and a constant, the BLUE Gem has a high initial range but low random subsequent range, while the YELLOW Gem has high range and random subsequent range. Note that the BLUE GEM is the only gem that has a "chance" to be 1 . 


### Feel free to improve this framework fellow magicians and stuff :)
