### this is a working version of Gem Collector , this version has all the functionality described on the homework task . This will be the basis for the remix of this Homework . 
> basic functioning Javascript, Wins / Loss counter , generating a random number and setting that numbers to the respective gems 
> basic layout and displaying of the generated numbers into the HTML file . If number specification is required , i can edit it to the homework specific numbers (after i eat :) ) . This is just a proof of concept that my code works as the video explained. 
> set a timer so the user can see if what his number is before it trigers the reset .
