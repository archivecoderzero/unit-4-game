//psuedo code and stuff:

//create global variable for the game , a var for the collected number.call it numCollect

// generate a random number , looks like there aare 5 instances that we need a random number ,1. random number for the number that we need to compare at , 2 3 4 5 are for the assignment of the random number for all gems.

// show the random number on the html file , this random number will be called "numCompare"

// when there is an onclick event ,this pertains to the click of a gem , add that rumber to numCollect , 

// create a function that compares the on click , this would be our for loop of when a numCollect > numCompare , ++ a score for wins , else , ++ scores on loss
